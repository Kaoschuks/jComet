			A JavaScript / PHP library for easily developing push-based web applications
		</div>

		<p>
			jComet is a JavaScript / PHP library for easily creating
			<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_(programming)">comet</a> based web
			applications built on top of the <a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a>
			JavaScript framework.
		</p>

		<p>
			Just about everything on the internet is, what in the industry is called, a "pull" technology. This means that
			your users request something, and you give it to them. What, though, do you do if you want to tell your user
			something, or "push" something to them, without them having toask for it ahead of time? For example, some
			event occurs on the server-side (eg. someone else posts something on your website) and you want to update them
			about this by sending them a message. You could set up some client side code that constantly makes repeated
			requests to the server (say, once every second or every few seconds), but that can put a heavy load on both
			the server and the client. So, instead, we just "push" the information to them.
		</p>
	
		<p>
			This type of technology has many uses such as updating a forum post or shout box as new posts come in or
			alerting a user when a particular piece of data becomes available for request. However, there are also tasks
			that jComet should not be used for. For example, if you want to set up instant messaging on your website, there
			are whole protocols set up to accomplish this.
